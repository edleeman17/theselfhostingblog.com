Join us and discover the latest in self-hosted applications and other open source technologies.

We built [The Self-Hosting Blog](https://theselfhostingblog.com/) to document our findings, we are two Software Engineers based in the UK. Whilst creating self-hosted applications separately we would often share notes on exciting technologies that we had discovered as well as any challenges that arose whilst setting them up. 

We decided to create this blog to document our findings over our time in the industry and to help others on their journey into self-hosting. We believe that when using services online you should never have to compromise on privacy or control. 

We also believe that self-hosted applications and utilities should be available to everyone. We have made it our mission to make our posts as accessible as possible, even to those just getting started with self-hosting and creating a homelab. 

So welcome to our blog, feel free to drop us a line any time.
